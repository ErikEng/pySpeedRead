pySpeedRead
===========

A clone attempt of Spritz's new speed reading technology

Currently works with OSX, but can be easily adapted to another OS

To run: python pySpeedRead.py filename wpm highlight-color

filename is a text file
wpm is a reading speed (220 is average. Try going higher)
highlight-color is the color of the middle vowel.

For example:
python pySpeedRead.py treasure-island.txt 400 yellow
