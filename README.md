pySpeedRead
===========

A clone attempt of Spritz's new speed reading technology

<strong>Currently works with OSX, but can be easily adapted to another OS</strong>

To run: <em>python speed-read.py filename wpm highlight-color</em>

<ul>
<li>filename is a text file</li>
<li>wpm is a reading speed (220 is average. Try going higher)</li>
<li>highlight-color is the color of the middle vowel.</li>
</ul>
<h3>For example:</h3>
<code>python speed-read.py treasure-island.txt 400 yellow</code>
